Getting Started
===============

Getting started with this platform is fairly simple, but there are a few things you need to set up and install. Follow this Installation guide to install the requirements and get set up. We use more systems than mentioned in the Installation guide, but these are already integrated into this repository and do not require any installation. I would recommend reading about all the different systems we use in Our systems later on when you're up and running. It's important to understand these to follow the structure of our project.

If you've installed all the requirements and are new to HTML, CSS and Javascript programming I would recommend going through the information below. Otherwise, visit Standard workflow.

Learning web programming
========================

The different languages have very different functions in web development. HTML is the skeleton of the website and the actual building blocks. How these building blocks are positioned, sized and generally styled is what we describe in CSS. CSS could be viewed as the face of the website, it's what makes it looks good. Lastly, Javascript is what gives the website life and handles its functionality. It's with Javascript that we define the events on button clicks, page loads and more. Javascript is also where we post and get data from a database. Below there are some guides and code references to these different languages. I would recommend doing a few guides till you feel comfortable with the structure of a web project and its coding styles. After that, you can take a look at our own project and start familiarizing yourself with that. The best way to get to know our project is by looking at the structure live in a browser while changing things. This is described in step 1-4 in Standard workflow.
