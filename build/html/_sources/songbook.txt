Songbook
=========

This is the **best** and the most *important* page of the app.

======================= 
Javascript Description
=======================

**songbook.js** contains the JS code for both the songbook page
**songbook.html** and for the individual song pages song.html.

Upon initializing the songbook page the API-endpoint **/songs** (link
to the API description table) is accessed and the JSON object is
retrieved. The JSON contains the songs in alphabetical order with the
song id, text, author and category. When the data is retrieved the
function **initSongList** is called. 

The **initSongList** function regroups the songs
according to the first letter and builds the html from the template of
the songbook. The first letter of the first song is stored in the first attribute *firstLetter* of a JSON object. Then all the songs with the same first letter are stored in an array which is then stored as the second attribute of the JSON object. For every first letter, a JSON object is created containing the actual letter and an array of the songs. These JSON objects are then pushed into the array **songList**.
