Welcome to the F-guild's app or the infamous F-app!

We're very glad that you want to work on our platform, but before you can start there are a few things you need to do. If you are new to web development I would highly recommend to visit :ref:`learning-web-dev` for various tutorials and general learning material. It's good to have a basic understading of the web and web development before getting into a more complex project, like the F-app. Otherwise, go ahead and follow the :ref:`Installation guide <app-installation-guide>` to get setup and running.

If you're already set up visit Standard workflow to learn more about how you actually work.

If you wish to learn more about the different systems we use you can read about them in the Our systems page.

We wish you the best of luck in your programming ventures. We're certain that you'll do great! Remember that you can always ask any of us older spodermons for help if you ever run into trouble. We normally don't bite, so don't be afraid.
