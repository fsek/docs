Framework 7
===========

Framework7 is a framework for building iOS and Android apps in HTML. This is already installed and integrated into this GitHub repository, so you don't need to install anything locally to start using it. However, it is still a good idea to look through Framework7's docs to familiarize yourself with their different components and our app's structure. Almost all of our components in the app comes from Framework7, so if you ever wonder what certain things are or how they work you can most likely find information in their docs.
