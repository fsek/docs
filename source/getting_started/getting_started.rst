Getting Started
===============

Getting started with this platform is fairly simple, but there are a few things you need to set up and install. Follow this Installation guide to install the requirements and get set up. We use more systems than mentioned in the Installation guide, but these are already integrated into this repository and do not require any installation. I would recommend reading about all the different systems we use in Our systems later on when you're up and running. It's important to understand these to follow the structure of our project.

If you've installed all the requirements and are new to HTML, CSS and Javascript programming I would recommend going through the information below. Otherwise, visit Standard workflow.
