Installing a text editor
========================

To actually start coding you also need a text editor, much like Eclipse for Java. For this project, I would recommend using Sublime Text. Sublime is a solid editor that is very straightforward, easy to set up and is what I use personally. If you have another editor that you prefer, that's perfectly fine too. Whatever editor you end up using just make sure to use our standard and set the tab width to two and indent using spaces (soft tabs). In Sublime you do this by going to Preferences > Settings, which should open a new sublime window with two columns. In the left column, there are the default settings and in the right your own personal settings. In the personal column, you want to add::

  "tab_size": 2,
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
  "ensure_newline_at_eof_on_save": true

Note, that you need to put a comma at the end of each line (except the last one) for the settings to apply.

You have now installed everything that you need to get started. However, before you can continue you also need to be able to write some actual code. The F-app is built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript and if you're not familiar with these languages I would recommend going through some guides/tutorials here. Otherwise, we'll take a look at the Standard workflow.
