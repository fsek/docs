Web Installation Guide
======================

If you are using Windows as your operating system, head over to the :ref:`operating-systems`
page before installing the web. Otherwise, assuming you now have a running Unix based OS in some way or another,
you can continue on and start following the installation guides below
to get set up and running. There is one for Mac users and one for Linux users.
Hopefully everything will go smoothly, but sometimes there are some
complications since all of our systems are different. They are fixable though,
your computer isn't broken. Just ask one of us older spodermen
for help and you'll be coding in no time.
