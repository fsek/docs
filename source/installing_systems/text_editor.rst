Installing a text editor
========================

To actually start coding you also need a text editor, much like when you use Eclipse for Java in the programming course (or the old course atleast). 
For this project, I would recommend using Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a solid editor that is very straightforward, easy to set up and is what I use personally. 
If you have another editor that you prefer, that's perfectly fine too. Whatever editor you end up using just make sure to use our standard (will work **AUTOMATICALLY** if you use VSCode)

To install VScode visit: `VScode download <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>`_

Download and install VScode. To get our text editor settings make sure that you open the project in the Docker container. If you don't have Docker installed visit :doc:`Docker installation <./installation_web/installation>` for more information.

Now you should be all done and ready to start coding.
