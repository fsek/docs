Spider Conference 2018
======================

The Spider Conference 2018 was the first Spider Conference. The task was to implement a quiz. Necessary preparations should be done in the backend to fetch new questions and display them in the app. The idea is then that when the user selects an alternative to the question, a request is sent from the app to the server which will respond if it was correct or not. If the alternative was wrong, then it should send an error and the user has to restart from question one.

`Here`_ one can find a detailed description of the task. The solution to this task is left as an exercise for the interested Spiderman.
