Useful things to know before using the system
=============================================

The website is programmed with a number of different languages with different functionalities. Depending on what you want to do you will have to learn some of the languages. The main distinction between the languages is if they run on the server or the client. If you want to do design and user interaction you will want to learn the client-side languages and if you prefer doing backend functionality you want to learn the server-side languages. Mostly when working on the website you will do both frontend and backend since most projects involve the client and server working together.


===========
Server-side
===========

When programming the server-side you will mostly use Python and SQL where SQL is boiled down to mostly SQLAlchemy. SQLAlchemy is a ORM (Object Relation Mapper) which makes **SQL INJECTIONS** much harder to do. We also use Pydantic which makes Python more like a statically programmed language.

In the server-side or **backend** most of the data storage and manipulation is done. 


Client-side
-----------

The client-side is mainly about user interaction. The languages you will use client-side are React with HTML, Tailwindcss and a little bit of CSS. HTML is usually not called a programming language but rather a markup language. It is used when structuring the visible content on the website. To style the content we use Tailwindcss and to add interactivity like drop-down menus we use React.

Every language uses frameworks to ease the development process. A few that we use are: Tanstack Query, Hey-API and React-dom.
