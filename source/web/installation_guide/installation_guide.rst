Installation Guide
==================

We recommend using a UNIX based operating system when developing any of our software, but for the website it's a requirement. You can **not** use Windows here. If you are using MacOS or a Linux distrubtion you can head over to the respective installtion guide below and start setting up the system. However, if you are Windows user you have some things to do first. No need to worry if you're though, we still love you. There is still time for you to come over and join us in the UNIX world where the grass is greener, especially developing grass. However, it can be a big transition to switch to a completely different OS, so it's understandable if you want to take things slow. Here are you're options:

  1. **Uninstall Windows completely and install a Linux distrubtion of your choosing:** I would recommend Ubuntu as a good rebound OS after you dump Windows. Ubuntu is cosy and gives you a nice introduction to Linux. After you're a bit more comfortable you can always switch to something more hardcore. It's completely up to you though.
  2. **Dualbooting Windows and Linux:** This is where allocate space for a Linux parition on your hard drive and have two OS on your machine. This works very well if you want somewhat of a middle ground.
  3. **Install a virtual machine:** Here you will keep Windows completely and rather install a program which runs a virutal Linux desktop enviroment. I recommend trying Oracle's VirtualBox and if that doesn't work well try VMware Workstation Pro.

Assuming you now have a running Unix based OS in some way or another, you can continue on and start following the installation guides below to get set up and running. There is one for Mac users and one for Linux users. Hopefully everything will go smoothly, but sometimes there are some complications since all of our systems are different. They are fixable though, your computer isn't broken. Just ask one of us older spodermen for help and you'll be coding in no time.
